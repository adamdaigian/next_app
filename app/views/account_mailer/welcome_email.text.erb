Hello <%= @account.name %>,

Thank you for signing up for the Beta ElasticBox Developer Edition.
Our goal is to provide developers with the same powerful tools that our enterprise customers use. Right now, our Developer Edition is in beta, available to a limited number of test users.

We want to make sure that we are building tools that are as valuable to developers as they are to our enterprise customers. We value your feedback and want to hear any comments or suggestions you may have. Please email feedback to alex@elasticbox.com.

Again, thank you for signing up to be a beta tester for our Developer Edition. Please do not hesitate to get in touch!
