Hello,

Thank you for requesting an invitation for the ElasticBox Beta Developer Platform. You have signed up with <%= @invitation.email %> and are invitation request number <%= @invitation.id %>.

In the past year, we have seen incredible adoption of our enterprise solution. Our goal is to provide developers with the same powerful tools that our enterprise customers love. Right now, our Developer Edition is in beta, available to a limited number of test users.

Developer accounts are rolling out now and your account should be ready shortly. Right now we are working hard to build boxes (application templates) to support your needs. Could you take 2 minutes (for real) to fill up this quick survey and tell us more about your specific requirements: http://bit.ly/17O7Qyx? 


Please let me know if you have any questions or comments (or if youâ€™d like us to send you an ElasticBox t-shirt). All my contact information is below.



Have a great day!
Best,
Alex
